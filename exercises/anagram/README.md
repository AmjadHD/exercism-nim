# Anagram

Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

## Running the tests

To compile and run the tests, just run the following in your exercise directory:
```bash
$ nim c -r anagram_test.nim
```
